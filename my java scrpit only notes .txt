var num1 = 22
var num2 = "11" 
let name = "amardip"
let age = 28

let newname = "     amardip   "
console.log( Number(num1) + Number(num2) );      // to convert from one data type to unother 

console.log( Number(num1) + Number(num2) );      // to convert from one data type to unother 


console.log(name.length);     // get length of the array

// if we never defind means it consider as 0 to end 

let about = `my name is ${name} and my age is ${age}`			// this make help us to write concatetion in esay way

there is totale 7 data type(primitive) in java script 
string 
number 
boolen 
int 
bigInt 
symbolls 
null
undefined 

undefined = means we create a variable but never set vaules for it called as undefined

let testname;
console.log(typeof(testname));

you can't create a undefined with const it only can be achived by let or var 

let testnull = null;	
console.log(typeof testnull );		// in this will show a data type of object 	but it atchully null 

to create BigInt 

var num = BigInt(12) or you can add numbers in braket with key word of BigInt();
or 
var num1 = 12n 		// add n at last or

you can't parfrom math opration on bigInt and number

we have comparisan oprater like 

>, < =, 

=== vs ==
when we use === it chnage vaule and datatype 
when we use == it only check the value 

!= not equle to 
!==	not equle to but this will check the datatype also 

basic if else stetment 

let age = Math.floor(Math.random() * 30);

if (age > 20){
    console.log("you can enter your at " + age)
}
else {
    console.log("you can't enter your at " + age)
}


this is the fizzbuzz with else if 
for (i=1; i < 51; i++ ){
    if (i%3===0 && i%5===0){
        console.log("fizbuzz")
    } 
      else if (i%3==0 ){
        console.log("fizz")
    } 
    else if (i%5==0 ){
        console.log("buzz")
    }
    else{
        console.log(i)
    }
   
} 

let name = "Amardip"
console.log(name.slice(1));

let name = "Amardip"
console.log(name.slice(0 -1));


we see for concatnet string we have to do havey lefting so we can use backstik `` and inside that we can call veriable 

`this is ${var_name} and my age is ${age}`

you can't keep const empty 

acthuly null variable showing object this is bug in JS 


below are falsy values  means this value come false when we run if condition and pass this value in veriable

false 
""
null
undefined
0 

 if (false_variable){
        console.log(" run code")
    } 
	else{
	console.log("false value")
	}
	
	
we have ternary(conditional) oprater that do same task as if condition but with less code 

let age = value

let drink = condintion ? "valueAssingTovalue" : "if_condition_fale_than_this_value_assing"

--------------
// this code will set drink value milk if age is less than or equle to 5 or it set coffe 

let age = 8 

let drink = age<=5 ? "milk" : "coffe"
	

-----------

switch statement 

let variable_name = value

switch(veriableName){
    case value_to_check:
        Your_codes
        break;         
}


-----------
   
in below code we check the value of day variable value and then if case value macth the that code block run and break 
if you never use break then it will run all case 

let day = 5

switch(day){

    case 0:
        console.log("sunday");
        break; 

   case 1:
        console.log("monday");
        break;       

  case 2:
        console.log("tusday");
        break;       

   case 3:
        console.log("wendasday");
        break;       
   case 4:
        console.log("thusday");
        break;       
   case 5:
        console.log("friday");
        break;       
   default:
        console.log("satarday");
        break;       
        
}

-------

whille loop is the code that check the condintion and run block of code till condintion false

let age = 1

while ( age < 18 ){

   console.log(`you at  ${age} `)
   age++
}

in this also we can use match oprater like gt lt, or and 

------------
for loop 

This is also work like while loop but here we have to give variable then check concatetion and increment value in condintion block 

for (let age =1; age <= 18; age++ ){
		 console.log(`you at  ${age} `)
}

in other way you can declear variable out side you just have to give ; at start this is not good practice 

let age =1
for (; age <= 18; age++ ){
		 console.log(`you at  ${age} `)
}


and we use brack in any loop to stop or exit code when particuler variable value is meet 

for (age =1; age <= 18; age++ ){	
	  if (age === 4){
		  break;
	  }
	 console.log(`you at  ${age} `)
}


This will only print till 3 and break a code when variable value is 4 


and we use continue to skipp when variable value meet and run block as it is 

for (age =1; age <= 18; age++ ){	
	  if (age === 4){
		  continue;
	  }
	 console.log(`you at  ${age} `)
}

it skip 4 and print all other value

-------

do while 

in while we first check condintion then run the code but in do while  we frist time run code the check condintion
means in while if condintion is false then code never run but if in do while if condintion fale still your code run at list one time 

do {
	your code 
}
while( condition);

------------------

do {
    console.log(`you at  ${age} `)
   age++
}
while ( age < 18 )


---------

array is refrence type in which we store multyple iteam and all this have a it's index we are using [] to declear it 

let fruts = ["apple","mango","banana"]			// use "" only string string for other data we 

console.log(fruts.length);
console.log(fruts[1]);

and we can have mix data type in single array 
you can chnage or add iteam in index like this 
 fruts[2]="new mango"		// if in index 2 any iteam it will chnage if not it will add 


 fruts[3]="banana"	
 
Note: array data type is object 
 
if we want to check is iit array or any other iteam with dataype object we can check that by below cmd 

Array.isArray(variable_name)

so we see how we can add new iteam in array by using abbow method but what if we want to add iteam at end of array for that we hav push 

fruts.push("greapes");

same way we have pop which remove the iteam from last 
fruts.pop() 



fruts.unshift("lemon")			// to add iteam at the start of index 

fruts.shift("lemon")			// to remove iteam from starting of index


Note: push pop is fast then shift unshift
